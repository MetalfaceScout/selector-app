Laravel version of Team Selector.

The [original version of Team Selector](https://github.com/csse3200/s24-randomgeneration-MetalfaceScout) is a school project written in vanilla JS. While there's nothing wrong with that, I'd rather have a good framework to build up a website I'm passionate about.

## What is it?

This is a team selector intended to be used for the Laser Tag game of Space Marines 5. It's not easy to make teams in SM5 (Space Marines 5), so this tool will help me and all other players who manage their sites to efficently create teams and run their games - all while creating balanced and fair games.



## Planned Features

- 12 Player selection
- Queen Bee
- 10 Player
- Basic Algorithm
- Selection Modifiers
- Selection History
- Integrate Predictor Model
- User logins for player pool saving and history
